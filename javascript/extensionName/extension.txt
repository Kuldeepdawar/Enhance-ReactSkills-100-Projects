Qustion - Shallow copy is not safe for nested structure and if you want sepration work
Example -
const original = {name: "kuldeep", address: {city: "ambala"}}

const Shallow = {...original}

Shallow.name = "dawar" // changed 
Shallow.address.city = "karnal" // changed

Question: Deep copy is copied completely independent and don't change in the original

const details = {name: "kaalu", address: {city: "karnal"}}

// deep use json
const deep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(details))

deep.address.city = "ambala"
console.log(details.address.city) = karnal
